						<h3>Intro</h3>
						<p>
							The big question that we need to ask before adopting new technology is why? Without getting too verbose here (because we do have the right hand menu which nicely summarizes the talking points in this article), I want to discuss why I'm so crazy for serverless.
						</p>
						<p>
							I'm a big Amazon Web Services (AWS) guy. It's empowered my career and really kickstarted my ability to create the life that I've always dreamed of as a young kid. Therefore, this tutorial will utilize many technologies provided by the AWS platform. This article applies to pretty much any other platform that offers serverless technologies.
						</p>
            <p>
              I am not saying that serverless is a one-size-fits-all technology. I wish, however there are many cases in which serverless would not make a good fit - maybe we can get into that another day.

						<h4 class="section-title">Costs Savings</h4>
						<p>
							Perhaps it's best to start with the overhead costs that you save by utilizing a serverless archistructure. Going serverless can save a TON on overhead, whether it be from hardware run-time or time spent managing the infrastructure. Let's say you have a website or application that doesn't have a ton of traffic. With serverless, you don't have to have this application running 24/7 "hot" on a server. With Amazon Web Services, you're only paying for resources that are used when someone is accessing your application or app. Depending on the application you're creating, this isn't usually an issue. However, if you have something that isn't utilized a lot, it can run slower the first time a user accesses it due to background resources needing to start up. This is the downside to serverless - it runs the code "cold".

						<h4 class="section-title">Less Management</h4>
						<p>
							Personally, I love the idea of a serverless architecture, mainly because it decreases the amount of server and infrastructure management that I need to do. Over the years, I've learned one thing - when I have to manually manage a ton of infrastructure, it's going to eventually break. Whether there's an issue with a service crashing, like HTTPD or MySQL, or what have you. Now, the flip-side to using managed services (which is what serverless is comprised of), is that you sacrifice a lot of customizability on infrastructure. It's not so much to the point where I'm against it, however. And I am one to like having their hands on the steering wheel.

						<p>
							Imagine if your application could scale to a million users, and all you had to do was click a button to allow automatic scaling. This is what serverless offers. You don't have to concern yourself with configuring auto-scaling groups and worrying if your settings are working for a real life scenario.

							When we use a serverless infrastructure, we're taking advantage of Infrastructure as a Service, which is fancy talk for having a lot of configurations and management handled by the service provider.

							There's no denying that a lot of us nerds do things differently just because we can. This technology is still relatively new, which makes it all the more exciting when you get things working. Serverless is still a buzzword. We're still in the pretty early ages of using serverless architecture, however the benefit nowadays is that it's been tested for years. We have industry experts that can provide best practices and impart wisdom. If you understand the benefits of serverless and learn to develop for it, there's no doubt that you'll become an extremely valuable asset for any company. As with anything, there are pros and cons associated with serverless technologies. In many cases, serverless will be an amazing fit for your applications. I certainly recommend creating brochure websites using a serverless approach. If you feel inclined to begin developing a serverless application, head over to the next article!
